<h1>World-DB-Spring-MVC</h1>
World-DB-Spring-MVC team consisting of Howard, Patryk S, Selam, Mamoon, Alastair, and Phoenix ðŸ‘‹.

## Project Overview
This project creates a Java applicaiton that uses an SQL database which contains a list of countries and cities, along with other details.
This applicaiton allows users to query certain fields within the database, while following the spring architecture layout: Entities->Repository->Service->Controller
We implement RestAPIs and endpoints to allow the following CRUD methods.

- POST /city: Adds a new city.
- GET /cities: Retrieves all cities.
- GET /city/{id}: Retrieves a city by its ID.
- GET /city/name: Retrieves cities by their name.
- PUT /city/{id}: Updates an existing city.
- DELETE /city/{id}: Deletes a city by its ID.
- The above is similar for the countries controller

## Acceptance Criteria
- Interact with the MySQL World Database
- Use Spring JPA to connect and communicate with the Database
- Use basic CRUD operations
- Provide multiple types of search methods
- Implement the service layer in your application
- Tested with WebMVCTests
- GUI to be provided via swaggar
- Secure endpoints wiht an API
- Error handling of API endpoints
